/**
 * A class for an agent that plays tit-for-tat. The agent starts by playing a "cooperate" action. If their opponent "defects" on them, then
 * this agent plays their "defect" action in the next turn. If their opponent "cooperates" again, then this agent will cooperate in the next turn.
 * The corresponding "cooperate" and "defect" actions for each agent need to be specified. When a new game starts, this agent will reset
 * to trying cooperate.
