/**
 * Provides an interface for different methods of learning rate decay schedules.
 * Learning rates can be defined either by state-action pairs, or by
 * state(-action) features. The learnign rate can also be peeked at without
 * affecting its value using the peek methods. Poll methods will cause the
 * learning rate to decay. Note that the poll methods also take as a parmater
 * the agent time at which the learning rate is being polled. This is because
 * it's possible for the agent to poll the learning rate for multiple
 * state-actions/features in any given time step, but if the learning rate
 * function is indepdent of the states/features, then it should only be decayed
 * once for that time index.
