/**
 * A class for transforming {@link burlap.oomdp.core.states.State} objects into
 * an object that can be trivially serialized by using the
 * {@link #serialize(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State)} method. This class does
 * not implement the {@link burlap.oomdp.core.states.State} interface, because
 * the serializable states do not have to reference specific
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.Domain} instances or
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.ObjectClass} for easy file portability. Instead, a
 * {@link SerializableState} is deserialized into an actual
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.states.State} object by calling the
 * {@link #deserialize(burlap.oomdp.core.Domain)} method, which takes the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.Domain} into which the state should be unpacked.
 * There is also a static method
 * {@link #deserializeStates(java.util.List, burlap.oomdp.core.Domain)} which
 * takes a {@link java.util.List} of {@link SerializableState} objects and turns
 * it into a {@link java.util.List} of {@link burlap.oomdp.core.states.State}
 * objects by calling the {@link #deserialize(burlap.oomdp.core.Domain)} method
 * of each element. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * In general, {@link SerializableState} objects should be constructed with a
 * {@link SerializableStateFactory}. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * A standard serializable representation that operates reading the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.objects.ObjectInstance} and
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.values.Value} objects returned by a
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.states.State} and explicitly representing their
 * information is the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stateserialization.simple.SimpleSerializableState} and
 * its corresponding
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stateserialization.simple.SimpleSerializableStateFactory}
 * .
