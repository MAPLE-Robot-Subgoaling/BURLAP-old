/**
 * This class provides a learning rate that decays exponentially with time according to r^t, where r is in [0,1] and t is the time step, from an initial
 * learning rate. A minimum learning rate value can be specified so that the learning rate is never rounded to zero. By default, the learning rate may
 * decrease to Double.MIN_NORMAL, which is the smallest fraction a double value can hold.
 * 
 * This class may be specified to use a universal learning rate that is shared regardless of state and action, or it can be set to have a different
 * learning rate for each state that is decayed independently of other states, or it may also be specified to have a learning rate that is independently
 * decayed for each state-action pair. However, the state-action decay will ignore any parameterizations of actions.
