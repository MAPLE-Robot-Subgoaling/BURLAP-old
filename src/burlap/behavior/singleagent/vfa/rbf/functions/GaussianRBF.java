/**
 * An RBF whose response is dictated by a Gaussian kernel. More specifically,
 * this RBF returns e^(-1 * d(x, c)^2 / e^2), where d(x, c) is the distance from
 * a query state s to a defined "center," c, of this RBF and e is a bandwidth
 * parameter on (0, +infinity) that affects the range of influence of this RBF.
 * The larger the bandwidth value, the more uniform the response it gives to any
 * arbitrary input state. The distance between the query state and the center
 * state is determined by a provided distance function.
