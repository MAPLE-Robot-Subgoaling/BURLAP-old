/*
 * This policy is for use with UCT. Note that UCT can only guarantee the policy for the initial state of planning.
 * However, the policy from states that lie on the greedy path from the initial state are likely "okay" as well
 * since they were used for the determining which action to take in the initial state.
 * 
 *  This policy follows that by defining the policy for states that lie along the the greedy path of the UCT
 *  tree. Any state not visited by the greedy path in the UCT tree is excluded from the policy and will result
 *  in an error if this policy is queried for such a state.
 *  
 *  This policy is probably best used for deterministic MDPs, though it will work for stochastic ones as well.
 *  A more robust policy would cause the planner to be called at each state to build a new tree.
