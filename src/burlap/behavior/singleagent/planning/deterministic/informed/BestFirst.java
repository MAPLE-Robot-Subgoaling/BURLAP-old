/**
 * An abstract class for implementing Best-first search planning. Best-first
 * search planning stores children node in a priority queue where the priority
 * of nodes is indicated by an f-function. Different Best-first search planning
 * algorithms are implemented by changing how the f-score is computed, which is
 * an abstract method of this class that needs to be override. A*, for instance,
 * is a Best-first valueFunction in which the f-score is g(s) + h(s), where g(s)
 * is the cost to state s, and h(s) is the heuristic score for s. Best-first
 * search requires checking if the open queue already has a search node stored
 * in it and possibly modifying its priority and back pointers if a better path
 * to it has been found. To efficiently provide that functionality, this class
 * makes use of a custom hash-backed priority queue (heap) which performs
 * contains tests using a hash map.
 * <p/>
 * If a terminal function is provided to subclasses of BestFirst, then the
 * BestFirst search algorithm will not expand any nodes that are terminal
 * states, as if there were no actions that could be executed from that state.
 * Note that terminal states are not necessarily the same as goal states, since
 * there could be a fail condition from which the agent cannot act, but that is
 * not explicitly represented in the transition dynamics.
