/**
 * This policy is for use with UCT. Note that UCT can only guarantee the policy for the initial state of planning.
 * However, the policy from states that lie on the greedy path from the initial state are likely "okay" as well
 * since they were used for the determining which action to take in the initial state.
 * 
 * This class defines the policy for states that lie along the the greedy path of the UCT
 * tree. Any state not visited by the greedy path in the UCT tree is excluded from the policy and will result
 * in an error if this policy is queried for such a state.
 *  
 * A more robust policy would cause the planner to be called at each state to build a new tree.
