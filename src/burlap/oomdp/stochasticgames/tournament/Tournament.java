/**
 * This class is designed to run tournaments of sets of users. It is
 * particularly useful when there are a large number of agents whose performance
 * is going to be compared in games in which only a subset of the agents can
 * participate at a time, for instance running a tournament of many agents in
 * 2-player games like iterated prisoner's dilemma. The Tournament class
 * requires a list of agents, a world generator and a match selector. The
 * MatchSelector determines which agents will be matched up in a game, which
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.AgentType} role they will play as and how
 * many matches there will be.
