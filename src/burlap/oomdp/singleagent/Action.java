/**
 * An abstract class for defining MDP action definitions. An {@link Action}
 * definition includes a name for the action, the preconditions for the action
 * to be executable, and, potentially, the transition dynamics if the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action} implementation implements the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.FullActionModel} interface. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * An {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action} is closely associated with an
 * implementation of the {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} class.
 * A {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} differs from an
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action} in that it includes any parameter
 * assignments necessary to execute the action that is provided to the
 * appropriate {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action} definition method. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * Typically, the name of the action along with the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.Domain} with which this
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action} is to be associated are specified in
 * a constructor; for example, {@link #Action(String, burlap.oomdp.core.Domain)}
 * . <br/>
 * <br/>
 * Defining an action requires implementing the following abstract methods.<br/>
 * {@link #performActionHelper(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction)}
 * ,<br/>
 * {@link #applicableInState(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction)}
 * ,<br/>
 * {@link #isPrimitive},<br/>
 * {@link #isParameterized()} <br/>
 * {@link #getAssociatedGroundedAction()} and <br/>
 * {@link #getAllApplicableGroundedActions(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State)}. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * The first thing to note about many of these methods is that a
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} is provided as a method
 * argument. The provided {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} is how
 * an {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action} implementation is told with which
 * parameters it is being applied. If your action is is not parameterized, then
 * this method argument can be ignored. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * The
 * {@link #performActionHelper(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction)}
 * method should have the affect of sampling a transition from applying this
 * {@link Action} in the input {@link State} with the specified parameters and
 * returning the sampled outcome. This method is always called indirectly by the
 * {@link #performAction(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction)}
 * method, which first makes a copy of the input state to be passed to
 * {@link #performActionHelper(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction)}
 * . Therefore, you can directly modify the input state of
 * {@link #performActionHelper(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction)}
 * and return it if that is easiest. This method will be used by planning
 * algorithms that use sampled transitions instead of enumerating the full
 * transition dynamics or by deterministic planning algorithms where there is
 * not expected to ever be more than on possible outcome of an action. In
 * general this method should always be implemented. However, in some rare
 * cases, it may not even be possible to define a model that can sample
 * transitions from arbitrary input states. In such cases, it is okay to have
 * this method throw a runtime exception instead of implementing it, but that
 * means you will only ever be able to use this action indirectly by applying it
 * in an {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment}, which should
 * know how to execute it (for example, by telling a robot to execute the action
 * in the real world). <br/>
 * <br/>
 * Implementing the
 * {@link #applicableInState(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction)}
 * method is how preconditions can be specified. If you do not override this
 * method, then the default behavior is that the action will have no
 * preconditions and can be applied in any state. This method takes as input a
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.states.State} and the parameters for this action (if
 * any), and returns true if the action can be applied in that state and false
 * otherwise. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * The {@link #isPrimitive()} method should usually return true and should only
 * return false for special hierarchical actions like an
 * {@link burlap.behavior.singleagent.options.Option}. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * The other three methods are important for parameterized actions. If your
 * action is not parameterized, consider subclassing
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.common.SimpleAction}, which is useful for
 * defining non-parameterized primitive actions without preconditions, because
 * it implements every abstract method except
 * {@link #performActionHelper(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, GroundedAction)}.
 * Otherwise these methods will need to be implemented to define the
 * parameterization of your action. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * If your action is parameterized, first, the {@link #isParameterized()} method
 * should be overriden and set to return true. Next, as noted previously, an
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} implementation stores a set
 * of parameter assignments that need to be provided to apply your parameterized
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action}. Therefore, for custom
 * parameterizations, you will need to subclass
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} to include data members for
 * parameter assignments and the {@link #getAssociatedGroundedAction()} should
 * return an instance of your custom
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} with its
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction#action} datamember pointing to
 * this {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action}. The parameter assignments in
 * the returned {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} do not need to
 * be specified; this method serves as a means for simply generating an instance
 * of the associated {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction}. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * The {@link #getAllApplicableGroundedActions(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State)}
 * method should return a list of
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} instances that cover the
 * space of all possible parameterizations of the action for in the input
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.states.State}. However, the returned list should
 * only include {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} instances that
 * satisfy the
 * {@link #applicableInState(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, GroundedAction)}
 * method. Do *NOT* include {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction}
 * objects that are not applicable in the input list. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * By allowing you to define your own subclass of
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} that is returned by these
 * methods, you can have any kind of {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action}
 * parametrization that you'd like. That said, A common form of
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action} parameterization is an action that
 * operates on OO-MDP {@link burlap.oomdp.core.objects.ObjectInstance}
 * references in a state (for example, stacking on block on another in
 * {@link burlap.domain.singleagent.blocksworld.BlocksWorld}. Therefore, if you
 * would like to have a OO-MDP object parameterization, rather than define your
 * own subclass, you should consider subclassing the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.ObjectParameterizedAction} class. See it's
 * documentation for more details. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * Also of note is the the
 * {@link #performInEnvironment(burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment, burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction)}
 * method. This method handles having an action executed in some
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment} rather than
 * simulated. In general, this method does not need to be overridden for the
 * vast majority of cases (one exception is hierarchical actions like the
 * {@link burlap.behavior.singleagent.options.Option} class, which overrides it
 * to have a sequence of primitive actions applied in the environment).
 * Typically, {@link burlap.behavior.singleagent.learning.LearningAgent}'s will
 * execute actions in the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment} from which they're
 * learning using this method.
