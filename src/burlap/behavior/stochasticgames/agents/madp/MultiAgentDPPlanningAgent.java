 * planning algorithm to compute the value of each state and then follow a
 * policy derived from a joint policy that is derived from that estimated value
 * function. This is achieved by at each step by the
 * {@link burlap.behavior.stochasticgames.madynamicprogramming.MADynamicProgramming#planFromState(State)}
 * being first called and then following the policy. Ideally, the planning
 * object should only perform planning for a state if it has not already planned
 * for it. The joint policy underlining the policy the agent follows must be an
 * instance of {@link MAQSourcePolicy}. Furthermore, when the policy is set, the
 * underlining joint policy will automatically be set to use this agent's
 * planning object as the value function source and the set of agents will
 * automatically be set to the involved in this agent's world. The
 * {@link PolicyFromJointPolicy} will also be told that this agent is its
 * target.
