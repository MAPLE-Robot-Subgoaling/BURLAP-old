/**
 * It is typical for options to be defined for following policies to subgoals
 * and it is often useful to use a planning or learning algorithm to define
 * these policies, in which case a terminal function for the option would need
 * to be specified in order to learn or plan for its policy. This terminal
 * function defines a set of states in which an option is applicable and the
 * subgoal states of the option. The subgoal state and applicable states are
 * specified using
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.auxiliary.stateconditiontest.StateConditionTest} objects.
 * The agent will terminate in any subgoal state or any state that is not an
 * applicable state.
