/**
 * It is typical for options to be defined for following policies to subgoals
 * and it is often useful to use a planning or learning algorithm to define
 * these policies, in which case a subgoal reward function for the option would
 * need to be specified. This reward function defines a set of states in which
 * an option is applicable and the subgoal states of the option. The subgoal
 * state and applicable states are specified using
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.auxiliary.stateconditiontest.StateConditionTest} objects.
 * By default, a subgoal reward of 0 is returned for transitions to the subgoal
 * states, the most negative value for transitions to states in which the option
 * is not applicable and -1 for any other transitions. All of these values can
 * be changed.
