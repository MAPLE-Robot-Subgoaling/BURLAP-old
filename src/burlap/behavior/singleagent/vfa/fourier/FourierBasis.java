/**
 * An implementation of Fourier Basis functions [1]. This class expects a
 * normalized state variable/feature vector of input states, if it is not
 * normalized, behavior is not well defined. Therefore consider using the
 * {@link ConcatenatedObjectFeatureVectorGenerator} generator with the
 * normalization flag set to convert the OO-MDP {@link State} objects into the
 * necessary input vector. The higher order the basis functions, the higher the
 * VFA resolution is. Typically, order n will produce (n+1)^d state basis
 * functions (and a copy for each action), where d is the number of state
 * variables. Since this grows quickly, a way to manage the complexity is to
 * simplify the number of coefficient vectors. That is, each basis function is a
 * function of the dot product of the input state variable vector and a
 * coefficient vector {0...n}^d and normally all possible coefficient vectors
 * (and their corresponding basis functions) for order n are produced. However,
 * this class can be told to limit the permitted coefficient vectors to those
 * that have no more than k non-zero entries in the coefficient vector. When k =
 * 1, all features are treated as indepdent resulting in n*d basis functions.
 * <p/>
 * When using a learning algorithm like {@link GradientDescentSarsaLam} with
 * Fourier basis functions, it is typically a good idea to use the
 * {@link FourierBasisLearningRateWrapper}, which scales the normal learning
 * rate by the inverse of the norm of a basis function's coefficient vector.
