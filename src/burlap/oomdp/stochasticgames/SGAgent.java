 * specific type of agent that is specified by their {@link SGAgentType}. Agents
 * are informed by the world when a game is starting and ending and they are
 * also queried by the world for the action they will take. After all agents in
 * the world have chosen their action, the world changes and informs each agent
 * of the outcome for all agents in the world.
