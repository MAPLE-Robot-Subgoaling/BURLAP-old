/**
 * An abstract class for defining RBF units. An RBF unit is defined by a
 * centered state and a distance metric that can be used to measure the distance
 * between the unit's center and an input state. RBF units return a response
 * value to an input state that is a function of the distance from the unit's
 * centered state to the input state. Different RBF subclasses implement the
 * response function differently. The less distant an input state is from a
 * unit's center state, the greater the response value.
