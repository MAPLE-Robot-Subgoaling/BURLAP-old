/**
 * For some algorithms, it is useful to have an explicit unique state identifier for each possible state and the hashcode of a state cannot reliably give
 * a unique number. This class is used to take hashable states and assign them a unique number. States can be enumerated iteratively on an as needed basis
 * or all reachable states from a source state can be queried to seed the list of states. This class can also go in the reverse direction
 * by returning the state associated with an enumeration id, as long as that id has already been assigned to a state.
