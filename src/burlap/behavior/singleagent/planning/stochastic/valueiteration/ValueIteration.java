/**
 * An implementation of asynchronous value iteration. Values of states are
 * updated using the Bellman operator in an arbitrary order and a complete pass
 * over the state space is performed on each iteration. VI can be set to
 * terminate under two possible conditions: when the maximum change in the value
 * function is smaller than some threshold or when a threshold of iterations is
 * passed. This implementation first determines the state space by finding all
 * reachable states from a source state. The worst case time complexity of the
 * reachability operation is equivalent to that of one VI iteration and has the
 * added benefit that VI does not pass over non-reachable states.
 * 
 * This implementation is compatible with options.
