/**
 * A class for an agent that plays tit-for-tat. The agent starts by playing a
 * "cooperate" action. If their opponent "defects" on them, then this agent
 * plays their "defect" action in the next turn. If their opponent "cooperates"
 * again, then this agent will cooperate in the next turn. The corresponding
 * "cooperate" and "defect" actions for each agent need to be specified. When a
 * new game starts, this agent will reset to trying cooperate.
