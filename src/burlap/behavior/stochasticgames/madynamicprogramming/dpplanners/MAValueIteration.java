/**
 * A class for performing multi-agent value iteration. This class extends the
 * {@link burlap.behavior.stochasticgames.madynamicprogramming.MADynamicProgramming}
 * class to provide value iteration-like value function estimation. When an
 * input state is provided via the {@link #planFromState(State)} method, if the
 * state has already been seen and planned for, then nothing happens. If the
 * state has never been seen before, then a state reachiability analysis is
 * first performed in which all states possibly reachable from the input state
 * are found. Then Value iteration proceeds for all states that have been found
 * in the past. The {@link #runVI()} method can also be called directly to force
 * value iteration to be performed on all states that have been previously
 * found, but the state reachability must have been performed at least once
 * before to seed the state space. State reachability can be performed manually
 * by calling the {@link #performStateReachabilityFrom(State)} method.
 * <p/>
 * Value iteration will continue until either the maximum change in Q-value is
 * less than some user provided threshold or until a max number of iterations
 * have passed.
