/**
 * An abstract class for providing action definitions that are selectable by
 * agents ({@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.SGAgent}) in a stochastic game.
 * This class is analogous to the single-agent action definition class,
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.Action}, except it does not include the
 * transition dynamic information which is instead provided by a
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.JointActionModel} that takes the
 * simultaneous action selections of all agents in a game and determines the
 * outcome. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * A {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.SGAgentAction} is closely
 * associated with an implementation of the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction}
 * class. An
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction}
 * differs from a
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.SGAgentAction} in that the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction}
 * includes parameter assignment information necessary for the agent to execute
 * the action. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * Implementing this class requires subclassing the following abstract methods:<br/>
 * {@link #applicableInState(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, GroundedSGAgentAction)}
 * , <br/>
 * {@link #isParameterized()}, <br/>
 * {@link #getAssociatedGroundedAction(String)}, and<br/>
 * {@link #getAllApplicableGroundedActions(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, String)}
 * . <br/>
 * The
 * {@link #applicableInState(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, GroundedSGAgentAction)}
 * method defines the preconditions of the action definition. The latter three
 * methods are important for defining parameterized actions. Note that if you If
 * you are defining a parameter-less action that has no preconditions (can be
 * executed in any state), then you may simply use the
 * {@link SimpleSGAgentAction} implementation for creating your action
 * definition. Otherwise, the {@link #isParameterized()} method should return
 * true and you will also need to implementing the remaining methods. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * As noted previously, an
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction}
 * implementation stores a set of parameter assignments that need to be provided
 * to apply your parameterized
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.SGAgentAction}. For custom
 * parameterizations, you will need to subclass
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction} to
 * include data members for parameter assignments. The
 * {@link #getAssociatedGroundedAction(String)} should then return an instance
 * of your custom
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction} with
 * its
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction#action}
 * datamember pointing to this
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.SGAgentAction} and its
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction#actingAgent}
 * data member pointing to the actingAgent argument. The parameter assignments
 * in the returned
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.SGAgentAction} do not need
 * to be specified; this method serves as a means for simply generating an
 * instance of the associated {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction}. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * The
 * {@link #getAllApplicableGroundedActions(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, String)}
 * method should return a list of
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction}
 * instances, covering all possible parameterizations of this action for the
 * acting agent in the given state. However, the returned list should only
 * include
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction}
 * instances that satisfy the
 * {@link #applicableInState(burlap.oomdp.core.states.State, GroundedSGAgentAction)}
 * method. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * Overriding these two methods and having them return a custom
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction}
 * subclass is all that is required to implement a parameterized
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.SGAgentAction} and by
 * allowing you to define your own subclass of
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.GroundedSGAgentAction}, you
 * can have any kind of
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.SGAgentAction}
 * parametrization that you'd like. That said, a common form of
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.SGAgentAction}
 * parameterization is an action that operates on OO-MDP
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.core.objects.ObjectInstance} references in a state. If
 * you would like to have a OO-MDP object parameterization, rather than define
 * your own subclass, you should consider subclassing the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.ObParamSGAgentAction} class.
 * See it's documentation for more details.
