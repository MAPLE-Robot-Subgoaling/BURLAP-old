/**
 * This is the standard interface for defining an agent that learns how to
 * behave in the world through experience. There are two methods that need to be
 * implemented.
 * {@link #runLearningEpisode(burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment)}
 * and
 * {@link #runLearningEpisode(burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment, int)}
 * . Implementing the former method should have the agent interact with the
 * provided {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment} until the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment} transitions to a
 * terminal state. The
 * {@link #runLearningEpisode(burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment, int)}
 * should have the agent interact with the
 * {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment} until either a
 * terminal state is reached or the agent has taken maxSteps in the environment.
 * Both methods should return an
 * {@link burlap.behavior.singleagent.EpisodeAnalysis} object that records the
 * interactions.
