/**
 * Implementation of Real-time dynamic programming [1]. The planning algorithm uses a Q-value derived policy to sample rollouts in the domain. During
 * each step of the rollout, the current state has its value updated using the Bellman operator and the action for the current state
 * is selected using a greedy Q policy in which ties are randomly broken. Alternatively, this algorithm may be set to batch mode. In batch mode,
 * all Bellman updates are stalled until rollout
 * is complete, after which the Bellman update is performed on each state that was visited
 * in reverse.
 * <p/>
 * To ensure optimality, an optimistic value function initialization should be used. However, RTDP excels when a good value function initialization
 * (e.g., an admissible heuristic) can be provided.
